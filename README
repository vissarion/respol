# some simple instructions

To compile the sources we assume you have installed the CGAL library.
Then you can go to examples directory and run:

$ cmake .
$ make 

Then you can test the code with some inputs from the examples/input 
directory. For example you can run 

$ ./res_enum_d_notopcom < inputs/cayley4_small.tmp

and wait ;)
