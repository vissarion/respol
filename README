# some simple instructions
# 

1. To compile the sources you have installed first the feature 
Triangulation of CGAL library. i.e.

$ svn checkout --username YOURUSERNAME 
https://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/cgal/branches/features/Triangulation-higher_dimensions-odevil_shornus

and then 

$ cmake .
$ make 
$ make install

if you don't have access to scm.gforge.inria.fr contact us.

2. Now you can get the sources for Resultant Polytope computation

$ svn co https://respol.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/respol respol

Then you can go to examples directory and run:

$ cmake .
$ make 

Then you can test the code with some inputs from the examples/input 
directory. For example you can run 

$ ./res_enum_d_notopcom < inputs/cayley4_small.tmp

and wait for the result ;)
